Description: It is difficult to visualize high-dimensional compositional data. One approach
    involves amalgamating the parts into a new set of composite features called "amalgams".
    This package uses genetic algorithms to find an optimal set of amalgams that satisfies an
    objective function. Although amalgams themselves are low-dimensional compositions, they
    are not sub-compositions. Rather, amalgamation acts like a kind of non-linear dimension
    reduction that can facilitate data understanding. Note that inferences made on
    amalgamations may not agree with inferences made on the full composition.
